#Description: 
  Hello, wellcome to my personal portfolio, I hope you enjoy it, and you see a differrence from when I first started to now.
  FYI I just learn this year what was a full stack developer. I have 0 experience and 0 knowledge about this sector. I got into it
  becaause of tiktok, and I'm so glad I push myself to learn this. This was truely the definition of learning something new, Do something 
  completly new. To continue living my life, and work and learn to put a pause so I can focus, maybe is a bitter sweet moment and writing 
  this is crazy to think I'm almost done. But I wouldn't change one thing, I got very lucky with my instructor, and I'm pretty sure he won't
  read this but Mr. Jung you have no idea how much I appreciate you and thank you for what you did for me. I don't have enough word to
  appreciate you and thank you for what you did, for taking your time to motive me and to trust you. Never I had someone who care so much for
  me as a student. You have a talent of teaching, and I just pray one day I get to be as efficiant as you while coding. To my TA's thank you guys, 
  Quentin my man thank you for allowing me to bother you since day 1, and for always helping me and motivating me. To ms. jessica thank you, 
  you an amazing person and the fact you learn this alone omg that a boss move, thank you for never making me feel stupid and always helping me. 
  To Mr. jay for always wanting for me to learn and sending me different articles so I could find the answer, I truely appreactied that. 
  To Mr. Paul didn't get the change to work with you but different classmate would tell me funny story about you, I hope I get to meet that side of you
  one day. To central grading, thank you for every feedback, I read all of them, event the one that were long "look like a book", but trust me when I said
  thank you for caring for someone you didn't know for taking the time and walways wanting the best of me. For this programn thank you for exciting, it was
  a beautiful journey, I cannot belive I'm done, hey I didn't do 2 homeowrk, but thank you for trusting in me. 
  I hope this app, this website you guys can see what I learn, for what i still need to learn. Thank you for pushing me to learn something new, and pushing myself
  to finish this. Now is time to spread my wings, thank you for building me. Thank you for being a part of me.
