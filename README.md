#Description: 
  Hello, wellcome to my personal portfolio, I hope you enjoy it, and you you see a differrence from when I first started to now.
  FYI I just learn this year what was a full stack developer. I have 0 experience and 0 knowledge about this sector. I got into it
  becaause of tiktok, and im so glad I push myself to learn this. this was truely the definition of learning something new, to
  continue living my life, and work and learn to put a pause so I can focus, maybe is a bitter sweet moment and writing this is 
  crazy to think im almost done. But I wouldn't change one thing, I got very lucky with my instructor, and I'm pretty sure he won't
  read this but Mr. Jung you have no idea how much I appreciate you and thank you for what you did for me. I don't have enough word to
  appreciate you and thank you for what you did, you have a talent of teaching, and i just pray one day I get to be as efficiant as you
  while coding, to my TA's thank you guys, Quentin my man thank you for allowing me to bother you since day 1, and for always helping me
  and motivating me. To ms. jessica thank you, you an amazing person and the fact you learn this alone omg that a boss move, thank you for
  never making me feel stupid and always helping me. To Mr. jay for always wanting for me to learn and sending me different articlas so I
  could find the answer, i truely appreactied that. to Mr. Paul didn't get the change to work with you but different classmate would tell me
  funny story about you, i hope i get to meet that side one day. To central grading, thank you for every feedback i read all of them, event the one
  that were long look like a book, but trust me when i said thank you for caring for someone you didn't know for taking the time and walways wanting
  the best of me. For this programn thank you for exciting, it was a beautiful journey, i cannot belive im done, hey i didn't do 2 homeowrk, but thank you 
  for trusting in me.
