                            Hello Everyone, I am someone who is very extroverted, hard worker, problem solver, persitent, friendly, leader, etc. But you can call me Andres. How you doing? Hope you doing good, thank you for taking the time to read my about me. I am someone how just went back to school and finish school, maybe I am a little older but like many of us I never knew what I wanted to do and settle for an "easy" job. Now i have done electrical work for over ten years plus, and even though I am in a very good spot as an electircian I knew I needed more in my life. I am someone who does not like to settle, someone who demand more to myself, and trust me this is so normal for me. You can easily ask anyone I know  and they could bouch for me and said I am a hard worker. I expect and love to bring the best each day, I love to be transparent and honest to people and mostly I enjoy going home knowing that my job is done "correctly", "beautiful",  "money saver". Yes, I do enjoy saving money to my boss, yes, you can save money in electrical, yes, coworker don't know how to fix stuff, and yes, is my duty to fix it. Do I like it? not really, why do I do it? I learn more, and like I said I love solving problem, No, I don't know everything but I don't like to give up. I would like to get an opportunity in this sector, so far is being challenging but you know that feeling of solving something, that feeling on accompleshment, that feeling you bad a**. That is the feeling that I wanna feel now and I hopping you, or someone you know gives me an opportunity. Might not be the most knowledgeble but i can promise you "You ain't never had a friend like me, ha!" -Genie.
