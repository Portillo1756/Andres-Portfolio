                            <p>
                                Hello Web People!!! My name is Andres Portillo. I'm a thrity year old, who
                                is married and I want to introduce myself to you guys. I have work as an 
                                electrician for the pass thirteen years and now I'm looking forward to exploring 
                                what this side of the internet is all about. I'm someone who enjoy challenges,
                                Therefore my current and past bosses have been able to rely on me . I don't
                                like to give up on the first sign of trouble I gotta admit I had lost a few
                                times but thats the beauty of why I enjoy electrical. It came to the point
                                where I feel that there is more in me than just doing electrical, That does
                                not mean im trying to say electrical is easy but it wasn't challeging me 
                                anymore. Also, I hate being bored at home and not being able to have some
                                type of challenge throughout my day. I also happen to realized that I enjoy
                                solving stuff within my brain and thats one of the things most coworker 
                                didn't had and they would love to tackle project head on and will realize 
                                mid way they were wrong. I know that I probably didnt get to learn everything
                                in electrical but I am ready to be able to take on this new challange and 
                                learn as much as I can. I can promise you that with me around I wont quit 
                                till we find a solution. I wish i was able to skip this next six month, and
                                live my best life without any headache but I know everyhting I'm going to
                                live the next couple of months will be worth it at the end.
                            </p>
